# CellPhone-File-To-Remailer

Send remailer messages via an uploaded file to a mixmaster server.

MixMailFromFile.sh

This script is run on a Linux server wherein mixmaster has been
installed. The script will run with an installed mixmaster client
alone. It does not require a full mixmaster remailer installation.

It was written for the purpose of sending remailer messages via
an uploaded file to a server. Remailer headers and message must be
uploaded up to the remailer server through a 'VX ConnectBot' ssh
connection.

See futher setup instructions within the Script file.
